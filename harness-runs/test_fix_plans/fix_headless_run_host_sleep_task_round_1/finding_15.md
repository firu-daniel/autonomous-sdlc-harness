### 15. Sandbox refusal (e): the GitHub Actions dispatch fails

**Site:** `cli/test/watcher-sandbox-refusal.test.mjs` → `test('(e) a drop sent to GitHub Actions never consults the probe and is dispatched'` (near line 165). Its pass goes through `cli/test/helpers/watcher.mjs` → `async tick(`, bounded by `const TICK_TIMEOUT_MS = 60_000;`. That pass runs `cli/templates/scripts/autonomous-watcher.sh` → `tick() {`, which on this branch runs `host_wake_pass`, `keep_awake_resolve` and `keep_awake_pass` ahead of the inbox pass, before the drop is cut into a clone, pushed and dispatched.

**Failing test:** `cli/test/watcher-sandbox-refusal.test.mjs` — `(e) a drop sent to GitHub Actions never consults the probe and is dispatched`

**The failure, quoted from the log:**

```
        not ok 1178 - (e) a drop sent to GitHub Actions never consults the probe and is dispatched
```

**Diagnosis, from the current tree.** This failure is *new this round*: there is no earlier log. The gate wrapper keeps only the `not ok` line, so no assertion message is on record.

The case's remote drop cuts a clone, commits, pushes and is dispatched, with no local launch. So the launch head is not on its path; only `tick`'s new prelude is. In the same file, (a) and (c) pass: they refuse before any working copy is cut.

Across the run, the failures do not behave like a defect in this path:
- In `cli/test/watcher-stall-reset-payloads.test.mjs` and `cli/test/watcher-review-drop-payloads.test.mjs`, whose cases run in series, the same drop path fails for the first consecutive cases and then passes for every later one. That includes the remote drops R1 to R5 in the review-drop file.
- The suite ran for `# duration_ms 2757435.082709`.

The likely cause is a transient condition on the gate host during part of the run. This log cannot confirm it.

**Suspected shared cause:** likely the same cause as Finding 1 — the case crosses the same drop-and-pass path as every other failure, and the failures stop part-way through files whose cases run in series.

**Fix.** No assertion is deleted, skipped or loosened, and no code change is planned from the log alone.

- [ ] If the unit's own evidence shows this case still failing against the current tree, fix the fault its assertion message names.
  - **The watcher's record, a log line or the dispatch:** the fault is in `cli/templates/scripts/autonomous-watcher.sh` (or `cli/templates/scripts/lib/harness-run-lib.sh`). Fix it there, and record under **Deviations from plan:** that the `general`-layer mirror (`scripts/autonomous-watcher.sh`, `scripts/lib/harness-run-lib.sh`) needs the same edit until `cmp` exits 0.
  - **A bare `runBash timed out after …`:** record it under **Deviations from plan:** as the next round's evidence, and change nothing.
- [ ] If the case passes against the current tree, the finding closes through `unit_loop_core.md` → `#### The already-passing close`.

## Already passing

- **Closed by the operator, not by a unit.** This finding's named test was **not** run on its own. The round-1 failures were caused by a second run's gate suite running on the same host at the same time (`feat_run_analytics`). Findings 1–13 of this index, closed one by one, each passed on its own with no code change.
- **Verification:** the round-2 gate run, which runs the whole suite. If this test fails there, round 2's test fix plan lists it again.
- **No code file edited:** this section is the only change, on `32a6e551`.
